git information

get on github site and login

create a new repository

First push to git

touch README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit" (to commit locally)
git remote add origin git@github.com:Rubiromi/DPL-notes.git
git push -u origin master (push to remote site)

Second push and on

git status
git add file-name
git commit -m "change I made"
git push

Branching

There are master branch with both local and remote(origin).

If I add something or try something different than the main branch, make branch and try on there.
That way, if I don't need it, I can erase the branch and keep the main branch as it was.

$ git branch
and I see * master

* means the current branch you are working on

$ git checkout -b sample (to create a new branch)

$ git checkout master(to get back to main branch. master branch already exist, I don't need -b)
